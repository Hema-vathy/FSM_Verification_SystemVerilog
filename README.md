# FSM_Verification_SystemVerilog
This project verifies a Finite State Machine (FSM) design using SystemVerilog. It tests correct state transitions, input-output behavior, and reset functionality. The verification ensures the FSM moves through valid states only, detects invalid transitions, and confirms accurate output responses under all input conditions.
